            <h3>I know you like to know what I like to imagine for us.</h3>
            <p class="lead">So I thought I'd share a bit!</p>
            <h4>One thing...</h4>
            <p>I like to imagine us playing games together on my super cool gaming pc that I built in our home, in its
                own room and it looks amazing! The windows on the side are open and it's a nice 85&deg;F outside, sun is
                shining, and it's not super windy. A small breeze is nice, though! You are sitting on my lap on the
                couch I had put in that room for this exact reason, playing a game on a big tv that I also put in here
                for this reason. You have a controler in your hand, and I do too, and we are playing games together.
                You, of course, are wearing shorts and a crop top because it is 85&deg; outside. I am also wearing
                shorts and a t-shirt. I don't know what game we are playing, because it's hard to tell what will be
                available then. I imagine it somewhere warm, not sure what state exactly, but somewhere where it is
                always warm even when it is rainy.<br>That is one thing!</p>
            <h4>Another thing...</h4>
            <p>I like to imagine in an appartment or condo somewhere in the not so distant future and I have a pretty
                good following on Twtich or YouTube (if that works out for me by then) and I'm streaming and you are
                there too with me playing games. This one isn't a very large one but I hope it happens.</p>
            <h4>It isn't that far into the future...</h4>
            <p>I know these aren't that far out into the future, and no they don't have kids in them just yet. That's
                just cuz I don't like to think that far out. Yes, I do want kids. And yes, YOU would be an amazing
                mother! I just have trouble imagining scenarios with kids in them because it's hard for me to do that.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: small;">That DOES NOT MEAN I don't want kids with you, because I think you would be an
                amazing mom for our kids!</p>
